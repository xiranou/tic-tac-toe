Challenge #1

Tic Tac Toe

Summary: Create a simple tic tac toe application using Ruby.

Core Requirements:
- You should be able to play against the computer.
- You should be able to pick who is the computer player and who is the human player.
- The application should run in the terminal only (no web interface)
- The computer does not need to be smart.  Randomly selecting an available space is fine.
- When the game is done, it should announce who is the winner and ask if you want to play again.
- Demonstrate a knowledge of object oriented programming
- Explain your algorithm for checking for winner patterns

Suggestions:
- Make the grid size variable
- Keep your code DRY
- Feel free to show off
- Test it using RSpec or MiniTest
- Make the computer player smart
- Randomize who gets the first turn between computer and human players

The suggestions are just suggestions if you want to play around or show us some cool stuff.  Have fun with it!  We look forward to seeing what you come up with.  Please make sure that you get all of the core requirements finished before moving on to the extras.

For this challenge, you do not need a database or 3rd party gems.  If you want to use active_support core extensions to simplify things a bit then that is okay.

Please try to get the challenge finished inside of 2 days.  If you think you'll need more time then please let us know.
